# This file makes Python treat the directory as a package.

# You can optionally import functions here to make them available 
# directly from the package, e.g.:
# from .comparison import compare_outputs
# from .compilation import compile_code_in_sandbox
# from .execution import run_code_in_sandbox
# from .checkers import run_custom_checker
